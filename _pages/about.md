This blog is my lil' [public garden](https://posit.co/resources/videos/your-public-garden/), I tend to write about a variety of topics from tech & data to things that fascinate me in any area of knowledge.

I am a physicist by studies and I've been working in/with **data science/ML/AI** since the glorious times it was still uncool. I love **science** and have this annoying obsession towards finding quantitative explanations for things. You can read some of my thinking and scientific journey in this <a href="{{ site.url }}/crossing-the-barriers" target="_blank">old post</a>. On the side, I produce **hand-drawn data vizzes** on various topics, usually lightweight (but not just), which I share here (and there).

## Projects & stuff

* My data stories are [here](https://martinapugliese.github.io/categories/#data/)

* [Askademic](https://github.com/martinapugliese/askademic) - an AI tool (agent) to help you find scientific research, summarise it, get answers, this was done with my friend [Bernardo](https://github.com/bernomone)
