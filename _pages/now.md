My now page, inspired by [D Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about) - what I'm up to now. 

# Autumn 2025 

Given the times and given my general interest in history I am trying to learn as much as I can about the history of the so-called "middle-East".

Reading literary dystopias continues but I'm alternating with other things.

I have also started writing a Gitbook about the grammar of the German language, the idea being that on linear paper you can't see the connections in a language very well, forced as you are to categorise everything into buckets. I aim to create a kind of a map, but with structured order.

Another thing I'm doing is evaluating new tools for keeping links, bookmarks and general internet stuff I want to keep.

Ah, I've started a project (as a blog) on data analysis about overtourism - [here](https://bernomone.github.io/citybreaking/)

# Late Summer 2025

German learning, started with Spanish, reading a bunch of dystopias, etc.
