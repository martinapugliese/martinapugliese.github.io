title: The podcasts list
---

AFAIK there isn't a tool you can use to review podcasts (something à la goodreads) so I use this page to list podcasts I really enjoy/enjoyed (if they're finished). Note: I exclude those I listen to for language learning. Lists are for English and Italian podcasts.

## Culture & miscellanea

* [Planet Progress](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9wbGFuZXRwcm9ncmVzcy5saWJzeW4uY29tL3Jzcw) (spring 2021, finished): the winners of the Google Impact Challenge, organisations and small businesses who are working towards a sustainable future. Narrated by H Fry
* [Desert Island Discs](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qnmr): I'm sure this is very well known by anyone in the UK - a very enjoyable and fun conversation between host and guest about 10 tunes they love
* [Today, Explained](https://www.vox.com/today-explained): from the Vox team of the Explained Netflix documentary show, dissects news and current affairs
* [Cautionary Tales](https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/cautionary-taless), narrated by Tim Harford, is about historical scams, frauds, intrigues & people's gullibility. Delightful.
* [ITA] [Certe Cose](https://www.ilpost.it/2022/04/22/certe-cose/) (terminato?): podcast di C Alessi realizzato con il Post, storia d'Italia attraverso oggetti trovati in elenchi che caratterizzano alcuni eventi
* [ITA] [Cose molto umane](https://www.cosemoltoumane.it/) - di G Kesten, io lo support su Patreon perché fa un lavoro eccellente. Kesten ne fa anche altri, tra parentesi, di podcast
* [ITA] [Avanti Veloce](https://www.raiplaysound.it/programmi/avantiveloce-viaggionelladhd), sempre di G Kesten e prodotto per RadioRai (sta su tutte le piattaforme), un podcast per capire meglio l'ADHD

## History & Stories

* Empire - by A Anand & W Dalrymple, this is great. The history of empires, in seasons
* The rest is history - T Holland & D Sandbrook
* [The Bomb](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/p08llv8n) (2 seasons), BBC
* [ITA] quelli della serie "Hai presente?": [Hai presente il 25 aprile?](https://choramedia.com/podcast/hai-presente-il-25-aprile/), [Hai presente la marcia su Roma?](https://choramedia.com/podcast/hai-presente-la-marcia-su-roma/), [Hai presente l'8 settembre?](https://choramedia.com/podcast/hai-presente-l8-settembre/)
* [The big steal](https://www.thebigstealpodcast.com/) (finished?): by G Esler, a very interesting reconstruction of the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union that led today's plutocracy
* [Wind of change](https://crooked.com/podcast-series/wind-of-change/) (2020, finished): a bit out there but I went with it as it's by P Radden Keffe, whose investigative journalism work I appreciate. It follows a crazy rumour whereby Scorpion's "Wind of change" was written/commissioned by the CIA for propaganda. It's interesting - I hate conspiracies and would have never chosen this but despite the wild story you learn a lot about the times

## Science

* [More or Less: behind the statistics](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02nrss1/episodes/downloads): BBC Radio 4 show hosted by T Harford, it debunks statistical myths, talks about how to interpret data correctly in a very lighthearted way
* [The curious cases of Rutherford & Fry](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07dx75g) (finished? I think it's coming back): hosted by A Rutherford and H Fry on BBC Radio 4, science's most curious facts
* [Complexity](https://www.santafe.edu/culture/podcasts) by the Santa Fe Institute, I especially recommend the series on AI
* [ITA] [Radio3Scienza](https://www.raiplaysound.it/programmi/radio3scienza) (in corso): storico programma di Radio 3 ideato da R Panarese, discute di argomenti scientifici con ospiti
* [ITA] [Tu che sei un fisico](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3ByZWFrZXIuY29tL3Nob3cvNDI0NjEzNC9lcGlzb2Rlcy9mZWVk) (terminato, per ora): di M Delmastro, che risponde a domande di fisica ricevute da ascoltatori, molto molto gradevole

## News/current affairs

* [ITA] [Stories](https://choramedia.com/podcast/stories/), di C Sala - episodi brevi sull'attualità, lei va sul posto e intervista gente, e fa un bellissimo lavoro
* [The David McWilliams podcast](https://davidmcwilliams.ie/podcast/): exploring and explaining economics via the analysis of current news

## Sport 

* [ITA] [Rimbalzi](https://choramedia.com/podcast/rimbalzi/) (un altro bellissimo podcast di Chora Media, finito?): storie di sport e sportiv*, intrecciate al contesto storico

## Tech
_I don't listen much to podcasts about tech, preferring to learn about things in other ways, so there's little here._

* [ITA] [Pointer Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/0iPhRabgwkHZMAjIFZRiOC), veramente ben fatto
