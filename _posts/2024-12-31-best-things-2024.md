Inspired by a [post](https://werd.io/2024/stuff-i-loved-in-2024) by B Werdmuller, I've decided to also draw a list of shows, books, movies and tools I really enjoyed in 2024.
I hope I've listed everything I wanted, but there's a chance I forgot some stuff.

## Books

### War and Peace, L Tolstoy

This was the year I partook to a year-long readalong of War and Peace. It was hosted by [Simon Haisell on Substack](https://substack.com/home/post/p-151884015?source=queue), which you can join for 2025. The book is long but the chapters are short (it was published in daily instalments in the first place), so it's a wonderful idea for a yearly project. 
Simon writes a nice daily overview sparking comments and feedback, and participants can have a chat. I really enjoyed the experience and as many said, it's one of those books that I'd have wanted to read but was put off but the sheer size.

War and Peace draws from themes of human nature, belonging, hypocrisy and truth, but it also contains deep reflections on history and the Russian soul and history. I've read the Briggs translation (into English), which is apparently a bit "britishisized", something I didn't love. I wish I'd picked up an Italian translation instead, but the other thing about this book is that you can read it over and over again and pick on something else every time, so maybe one day.

### Poverty, by America, M. Desmond

Tragic and informative. The tale of how social and economic inequality in the USA came to be a feature, not a bug. You may or may not agree with all suggested causes and the political stance, but it's nevertheless a great read.

### Guns, germs and Steel: the fate of human societies, J Diamond

It's a cult now, criticised for being simplistic and/or too speculative. Regardless, I've learned a lot. Geography and local characteristics played a huge role in making it so that some societies developed faster and more profoundly than others, ending up dominating. 

### The Patriarchs: the origins of inequality, A Saini

This is great - in fact, I've drawn many [quotes](https://martinapugliese.github.io/quotes/) from it. How one gender ended up giving itself the right to oppress the other didn't have to be a necessary development, nor it was always and everywhere the case.

### Animal Farm, G Orwell

Another classic of course. Doesn't age.

## Movies 

### Conclave

So good. Power, centuries-old tradition, patriarchy and a lot of twists with some hilarious moments. Clever too.

### One Life

The real story of a British young man who saved many Jewish kids from Central Europe organising the Kindertransport - trains that would bring them to the UK in a scheme that allowed them to be temporarily hosted by British families. Many stayed.

### Small things like these

Patriarchy and religion in rural Ireland, the '80s. Inspired by the real events of the Magdalene Laundries. Cillian Murphy is amazing and this, despite being a bit slow, is really good.

## Shows

### Fallout

It's on [Prime](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.8276269a-402e-4ece-a2b0-4eb5e2504a05?autoplay=0&ref_=atv_cf_strg_wb). You don't have to know about the game before watching it. Dystopian, disturbing. A critic of excessively unregulated capitalism, because we humans can't moderate ourselves?

### Hornblower

This is an old ('90s) British show, about the naval battles of the Napoleonic period. I like period dramas but I was surprised at how gripping I found this.

### Young Sheldon

There was something light I watched too! This is really good, I've been late to the party as I felt like it would be hard to replicate TBBT but this, despite being very different in style, is very funny, lighthearted and just enjoyable.

## Tools

### Readwise & Reader

A year after I signed up, still very happy with it. Good for bookmarking articles, sign up to newsletters, annotate.

### Buttondown

Ever since [I moved from Substack](https://martinapugliese.github.io/doodling-data-reloaded/), very happy. Smooth UI, easy customisation, and most importantly, focus on the writing.

_Here's to another year of new great stuff._
